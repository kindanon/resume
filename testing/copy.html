                        I am an inviting eatery with a laid-back atmosphere and enticing Italian cuisine. I am an outpost of Montreal’s much-loved Pizzeria Moretti, bringing such signature dishes to Toronto as antipasti, pizza and pasta, and gourmet desserts like our famous Nutella-and-strawberry pizza and homemade ice creams. I am located in the heart of Home Société with a second entrance that opens onto Cartwright Street. I am fresh, unexpected, authentically Italian and scheduled to open soon. I am many things.

<h3><b>What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This Policy covers the treatment of personally-identifiable information, i.e. any information that identifies an individual, or can be used in conjunction with other information to identify an individual (“</span><b>Personal Information</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">”) and other information gathered by G2MC when you are visiting a Website and / or using the Services.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This Policy does not apply to the general practices and treatment of information (whether Personal or not) by third parties that G2MC does not own or control, including but not limited to any third-party websites or services that you elect to access through the Websites or via a link from the Websites (“</span><b>Third-Party Websites</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">”), or to individuals that G2MC does not manage or employ. While we attempt to facilitate access or link only to those Third-Party Websites that share our respect for your privacy, we cannot take responsibility for the content or privacy policies of those Third-Party Websites. We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies of any Third-Party Websites you access. We have named and provided links to the most important of these Third-Party Websites elsewhere in this Policy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, this Policy does not cover any Personal Information you send to G2MC via any non-secured, non-encrypted mode of communications such as email, instant messenger or other messaging service, or Twitter or any other social media, as communications via these methods may be subject to interception, loss, or alteration.
